#Drag-n-Drop   

##Overview
Hey guys! This is Tony Ferlazzo with my answer to your coding challenge. 

You said:

Create a webpage that displays a gallery of images, given a JSON array
containing a list of image URLs.

Here are the requirements:
- Do not use any Javascript libraries or frameworks for your webpage.
Javascript build tools are ok.
- ES5 or above is preferred.
- The basic layout should be a grid of pictures.
- The images should be reorder-able by dragging and dropping.
- Any other functionality is not expected.
- The submitted code should be runnable and viewable. Add any
instructions necessary to a README.md file.


You are provided with a directory of sample pictures for convenience.

Note: Initially there was no directory provided. Sent a quick email to the recruiter to see about obtaining it.
 In the mean-time I'll use my own and get everything else set up.
 
##My dev environment:
 http server: 
 
 &gt; npm install http-server -g
 
 ##Usage
 Starting http-server locally
 
 &gt; cd project_directory

 &gt; http-server
 
 Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your server
